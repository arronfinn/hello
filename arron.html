        <h2 class="question">Why Join The <a href="http://growthtribe.io/" target="_blank">Growth Tribe?</a></h2>

        <p> I applied to join the tribe because I believe it will provide me with the necessary skills to
          utilise my creativity and insightfulness to the best of my ability. I love that the course focuses
          on including the idea generation and coding skills necessary to implement.
        </p>
        <p> Once I have finished the course, I will immediately start implementing what I have learnt into
          side-projects which I am involved with. Personally, I strongly believe that everyone should be involved in side projects. Otherwise
          you will experience a set of problems which ends up in tunnel vision. Experiencing a variety of
          problems will mean you become stronger as a professional.
        </p>

        <caption>Picture with Gaudi at the gift centre just before Parc Guell. I truly love Barcelona.</caption>

        <h2 class="question">What Makes Me Unique?</h2>

        <p> I strongly believe in Albert Einstein’s quote, <em>‘imagination is more important than knowledge,
          knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the globe’</em>. For me this quotes outlines the importance
          of being creative and imaginative with your products, marketing and business.
        </p>
        <p> Currently with the side-projects that I am involved in they are all at the very beginning which
          is a point in the process that I love. It means that each project can be shaped in any possible way.
          On my side, I will aim to entwine creativity and imagination into everything we do with these side projects.
        </p>
        <p> I believe the growth hacking principles will fit perfectly because it will allow me to see
          what was a great idea or stupid much quicker than usual. Thus, this will mean that we can test
          more and run with the success which is something I am really excited to experience.

        <h2 class="funny"> Something Funny?</h2>
        <p>Something funny, for me is the story of my Goofy. I got Goofy when I was just <strong>six weeks old</strong>
          but thus he travelled everywhere. Like some kids might bring a blanket, Goofy came far and wide with me.
          He travelled across Ireland and even as far as Wales for a Holy Communion and a Wedding in England. Ever since he has sat
          in my bedroom, a little worn and a little traveled. </p>
        <p>The wedding in England was very eventful because I was at the back of the church fightig over goofy because
        another little girl wanted him. If you could picture two little kids no older than two and half, pulling out of Goofy.
        I lost the fight but eventually I got Goofy back. Not before my parents had to buy another presenet for the little girl. </p>
